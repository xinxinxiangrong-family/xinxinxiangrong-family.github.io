## I. From Langzhong to Nanchong

I traveled from Langzhong to Nanchong on August 26, 1938. Before departure,
Comrade Maoji Tang told me that I should not carry my organizational relations
with me, for fear of problems. I was instructed to go to Nanchong and then to
the Minzhong Education Hall[^1] at Jingjiang Building to find a comrade named
Jingbo Chen (also known as Chen Wen)[^2] for contact. At the same time, Zuo
Lisheng also came to Nanchong Normal School to study, and his relations were
transferred separately. Jianyi Cao and Ruichen Qiu[^3], who lived with me at
Sichuan Provincial Nanchong Middle School, also transferred their relations to
Jingbo Chen with me.

On the third day after arriving in Nanchong, August 28, I found Comrade Chen
Jingbo at the Minzhong Education Hall. He was short, had parted hair, and
dressed very plainly. I introduced myself first as Cai Zhenyu from Langzhong. He
said happily, "I know, I know. Have the students Cao and Qiu arrived?" I replied
that they had arrived at the school but hadn't come today. It seemed that our
situations had already been forwarded to him. He took me to his small office on
the second floor. The room was filled with books and newspapers, and there were
manuscripts on the desk. He was editing a newspaper. After exchanging a few
pleasantries, he briefly introduced the situation of the school to me. The gist
was that the school once had a glorious revolutionary tradition and many
revolutionaries had emerged, some of whom had already sacrificed under the
enemy's butcher's knife. Since the period of the civil war and the white terror,
the party organization there had been severely damaged and was unable to
recover. Due to the current Nationalist Party-Communist Party cooperation, the party organization had some
development. Among the students who came to Nanchong to study from various
counties, some were party members. Just from Langzhong, three had arrived, and
it was estimated that some would arrive when school started, and then a party
branch could be established. After talking about the current situation and
tasks, he said: "The Nanchong Middle School is going to establish a party
branch, and I am planning to put you in charge." At the time, I was very
surprised, and quickly said: "I just joined the party, and I'm only sixteen
years old this year. I can't bear such a big responsibility." He patiently
advised me: "It's okay. You can learn while working, and you can come to me
whenever you have difficulties." At that time, I felt very conflicted - if I
didn't do it, I would be afraid that people would say that I was not obeying the
organization. But if I did it, I was afraid of not doing it well. After thinking
for a moment, I finally agreed. Then Comrade Jingbo gave me three tasks:

1. Expand the party's strength by recruiting a large number of new party members.
2. Actively participate in anti-Japanese and national salvation propaganda
   activities, widely promote the party's stance on the united front of the
   anti-Japanese and national salvation, and expand the influence of the party.
   Discover activists through the national salvation movement and absorb the
   advanced individuals among them into the party.
3. Strengthen the education of party members. First, require me to learn theory
   and knowledge, and organize party members to study.

Finally, he pointed out that although the Nationalist Party and Communist Party had already cooperated,
the party organization was still in a state of being an underground party. He
emphasized the importance of maintaining secrecy and minimizing "horizontal
relationships"[^4]. There should be no large meetings, and party members should
have a direct relationship with me. He also specified the code for transferring
relations to me: Whenever a letter mentions "my friend" so-and-so "student",
that person is a party member. Sure enough, two days later, a short, plump young
man came to find me and gave me a letter. It read: "Introducing my friend,
Student Jiasheng Zhang to you. He is studying in Class 7. I hope you can help
him and make a friend. Chen." From then on, we had four party members.

## II. Establishment of the Organization

On September 17th, school officially started. It was on that day that I learned
the results of the examination, which had been published in the newspaper. On
September 17th, Jiasheng Zhang, Jianyi Cao, Ruichen Qiu and I, under the pretext
of reading the newspaper at the Minjiao Hall, went to see Jingbo Chen. He
announced to us: the Communist Party organization was established at Nanchong
Middle School. According to the "Sixth National Congress"[^5] Party
Constitution, a "branch affairs meeting" (later referred to as the branch
committee) would not be established if there were fewer than five people. He
then designated me as the branch secretary[^6] on the spot.

In my diary dated September 18th, 1938, it was written: "Today is the
commemoration day of the establishment of the Combat Student Team". I still
remember the scene at that time. That morning, I told Jiasheng Zhang that the
branch was officially established, and the junior high school department was
assigned to him to be responsible for, and he was directly related to me. After
dinner, Qiu, Cao and I went to the playground to play. That day was the "9.18"
Day of National Humiliation[^7]. For fear of exposure, Jiasheng Zhang did not
participate. The three of us softly sang the "Exile Trilogy", and paid a silent
tribute to the martyrs who died. That was the "commemoration" activity of the
establishment of the party branch. (That evening, the school held a "National
Humiliation Commemoration" meeting, and Wu Song[^8] gave a speech.) From then
on, the party organization of Nanchong Middle School was restored. After this,
the situations of the subsequent branch leaders were as follows:

* September 18, 1938 - May 8, 1939. Secretary: Zhenyu Cai (In February 1939, the
branch affairs meeting was established, with Jianyi Cao as the organization
officer and Chuanlu Liu as the propaganda officer.)
* May 9, 1939 - Secretary: Jianyi Cao, Organization: Xiao Zhixin, Propaganda:
Chuanlu Liu

### Organizational Life

During this period, the following people led our branch:
* Jingbo Chen: August 1938 - October 1938
* Chuanji Liu[^9]: October 1938 - January 8, 1939
* Cunxin Yu: January 8, 1939 - May 1939 (official contact on November 27, 1938)

Boke Zheng[^10] came a few times in the capacity of an inspector. As written in
the diary on October 16th, "Liu introduced us to the newcomer Zheng, and we had
a long conversation in the restaurant from ten to one. This man is really
amazing."

## III. Conducting Activities

After the establishment of the Party branch, we carried out some work under the
leadership of comrades such as Boke Chen, Chuanji Liu, Cunxin Yu, and others, mainly
focusing on the development of grassroots organizations[^11], spreading
propaganda for national salvation, and self-learning of the Party members.

### 1. About Organizational Development Work:

Adapting to the circumstances of the time, we primarily identified advanced
individuals as development targets in our daily activities of national
salvation.  The method of developing new Party members was individual
development, maturing one, developing one.  The places for ceremonies were the
"Public Tea House," "Guo Mountain Park," and "Life Bookstore" on Da Bei Street,
among others.  There were superior leaders participating each time we developed
Party members.  After 1939, we held the ceremony ourselves.  According to the
"Diary", the Party members I developed alone included Jianyi Cao, Ruichen Qiu,
Zhixin Xiao, Lihua Jin, Song Wu, Minghuang Chen, Zhiqiao Dai. In addition,
during the winter vacation (1938), I introduced Hongxian Zheng and Shangmin Tang
to join the Party in Langzhong.  There were also Party members transferred from
other places, including Jiasheng Zhang, Angu Hu, Ziqun Jia, Chuan Liu, Shixiong
Dai, Shiying Liu, and others.

In this way, by February 1939, there were more than ten Party members,
with the agreement of Comrade Chuan Liu, a branch committee was established. The division of labor was: Branch Secretary Zhenyu Cai, Organization Officer Jianyi Cao, Living Officer Chuan Liu. The work of the junior high school department was still the responsibility of Comrade Jiasheng Zhang.

### 2. Actively Participating in Anti-Japanese National Salvation Propaganda Activities

From 1938 to the first half of 1939, the relationship between the Nationalists
and Communists was relatively normal nationwide; In Nanchong, the central
members of the Party did a lot of top-level united front work, The then
Commissioner Xian Ying[^12] had progressive thoughts and supported anti-Japanese
national salvation activities; At school, Principal Dazhang Yang was also a
progressive person, Coupled with the support of Teacher Ziqun Jia and Guidance
Director Tianming Huang in all aspects, All of these created very favorable
conditions for us to carry out propaganda activities for national salvation.
Under the continuous guidance of the superiors, we took advantage of this great
situation, using legitimate student organizations, we started this work:

#### A. Form of Activity

1. At school, we used forms such as student meetings, weekly meetings, and class
   meetings for speeches;
2. ……
3. Participated in the "Propaganda Team" temporarily organized by the school for
   verbal propaganda in rural areas;
4. Self-scripted and performed art programs, performed in the city and toured in
   rural areas.

#### B. Propaganda Content

1. Unite to fight to the end, implement the Anti-Japanese National United Front;
2. "Donate Winter Clothes";
3. Use the National Oath Movement of the National Covenant[^13] for propaganda.

#### C.

Several larger propaganda activities are detailed in the diary, excerpts are as follows.

……[^14]

### 3. Study of Party Members' Own Theoretical Policies and Education of Basic Knowledge of the Party

Regarding theoretical study: The "Diary" records that the books I read in a year
include "Leninism Questions", "Twelve Lectures on Social Science", "Basic Course
of Social Science", "On Political Party", and others.  Some even took notes.  I
subscribed to a copy of the "Xinhua Daily" and the "Liberation" magazine.  The
resolution of the "Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Party Congress", I read it
in the "Xinhua Daily".  Regarding "Zhang Guotao's Defection from the Party" was
orally conveyed by Chuan Liu, and later read it in the "Xinhua Daily".  Chairman
Mao's "On the New Stage" was first seen in the "Liberation" magazine, and later
bought at the Life Bookstore on Da Bei Street.  Reading these things is all a
unified arrangement from above.  The superiors had higher requirements for me,
requiring me to study first, The main method was extracurricular reading, and
individually tell Party members about their own experiences, and requires Party
members to study as well.

Regarding the study of Party member documents, In one year, our branch only saw
the mimeographed document "Party Building" once.  It contains "The Nature of the
Party" (vanguard of the proletariat) and tasks and organizational rules, etc.
This was given to me after January 1939.  After I circulated it among the branch
officers, we three separately conveyed it to Party members individually.

In January 1939, Liu hosted a Party training class.  I went there specifically
to study with someone.  Zhan He, the secretary of the vocational branch.  A
total of four people.  Time from January 16th to 18th, three nights.  The
content includes the organizational system, democratic centralism, iron
discipline, united front.
