To this day, I still keep two diaries called "Book of Life" I and II (hereinafter referred to as the diary).
It was preserved underground during the "White Terror" by my elder brother*, and was given to me after the liberation.
It records some situations of participating in underground party work and student movements from August 17, 1938, to May 8, 1939.

My great-grandfather Cai Guozheng was a military scholar during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. From the plaques hung on the main house door seen since childhood, it seems that the family was fairly prosperous. However, my grandfather's generation went bankrupt. By the time of my father, it continued to decline. My father, Cai Chunxu, only attended a short-term private school in his youth, because all the ancestral lands had been sold. My father had a deep impact on my siblings and me, because he can be considered a "reviving figure". Under the condition of extreme family economic hardship, he studied hard on his own, studied \*\*\*\*, and went to Shunqing (now Nanchong) Longmenchang to learn from the famous doctor, Mr. Lai Shaozhou. After carrying the "yellow pack" for three years, he started practicing medicine on his own. Due to his relatively good medical skills...
