## A Night of Stories

My grandma, Xin Zhao (赵欣), passed away on March 8, 2022, at the age of 93.

To be honest, while she was always very kind to me, I hardly knew anything about
her life during my growing up years. When I was in college, my grandpa passed
away, and my grandma moved to the US. Since then, we had few chances to see each
other again.

However, one night shortly after my grandpa's funeral, grandma and I sat vigil
together for grandma. While waiting for my grandpa's spirit to come home, she
shared some stories about herself. What follows are the stories she told that
night.

## Early Life

My grandma spent her childhood in a village in Langzhong County (阆中县),
northern Sichuan province.  This was during the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).
Langzhong was far from the front line, but it was repeatedly bombed by Japanese
airplanes. As a young girl, my grandma once saw the corpse of a farmer killed in
an air raid lying motionless on a road. Her voice was filled with anger when she
described this senseless killing.

The only benefit of the air raids was that a middle school in Langzhong was
evacuated to her village. The wife of a middle school teacher, 
a well-educated lady, opened an elementary school in my grandma's village.
This gave my grandma a chance to get an education and
was an important turning point of her life.

Later, her father, who was extraordinarily enlightened for his time, sent my
grandma and her elder sister to a middle school in the city of Longzhong. They
both did well and became elementary school teachers upon graduation.  By this
time, she had already achieved what was impossible for most women in China at
that time. But her journey to the wider world had just begun.

## Marriage with My Grandpa

My grandpa, Xiangrong Cai (蔡向荣), also came from Langzhong.  As a teenager, he
ran away from a comfortable home to join the army lead the Chinese Communist
Party to fight the Japanese invaders. After surviving the Sino-Japanese War and
the Liberation War, he returned to Langzhong and asked his sister, my grandaunt,
to find him a fiancee. My grandaunt was a also a teacher what had taught my
grandma.  So she proposed this marriage to my grandma.  Although she had
never met my grandpa, grandma said yes.

Thus, my grandma and her mother travelled from Langzhong to Xi'an (西安), where
my grandpa's was stationed. Nowadays, such a journey takes about three hours by
high-speed trains. But at the time, the roads from Sichuan to Xi'an were
treacherous.  It took grandma several days to travel by bus.

To her surprise, my grandpa did not like her when they finally met and tried to
break the engagement, allegedly because she was a bit too short to be his ideal wife.
Grandma must have been disappointed after enduring such an exhausting journey
only to have her hope for a new life dashed. But she put herself together and
told my grandpa,

> "It's fine if you don't want to marry me. 
> But please help me find a job in Xi'an
> and I will take care of myself and my mom. 
> Everyone back home knows that I'm supposed to marry you; 
> I cannot go back like this."

To this day, I still remember her gentle yet courageous voice when she recounted
these words that night.

Perhaps her attitude moved my grandpa. They ended up getting married. 
Their marriage lasted 53 years until the day my grandpa passed away.

## A New Career

After marrying my grandfather, my grandma studied at a medical college and later
became one of the first generation of doctors in the People's Republic of China
who received modern medical training.

At that time, such doctors were very rare in China. So even though she had never
received surgical training, a colleague tried to teach her to perform minor
surgeries on patients. Unfortunately, my grandma's hands were too gentle to
make an incision in a patient's skin. So she remained an internist until her
retirement.

During the Korean War, some injured soldiers were sent to her hospital for
treatment. Among them was a paraplegic soldier who was very distressed and often
hurled abuse at doctors and nurses. "But when it was my turn to take care of
him, he never yelled at me," my grandma proudly said. This is the only time
I remember my grandma bragging about something she had done.

## Legacy

After grandma's funeral, I visited her youngest brother, who was too frail to
attend the funeral.  As we talked about my grandmother, he told me,

> "I still remember when I was young, 
> she bought me books and encouraged me to educate myself. 
> Our generation lived through some really hard times. 
> But no matter how bad the circumstances were, 
> your grandma always tried to improve herself and her situation. 
> I have always admired her for that."

I don't believe in afterlives and reincarnations. Flesh and bones are all I
know. But when I think of my grandma, I believe that she still lives on — not as
a supernatural 👻, but as our memories and inspirations. That is her legacy.
